# Welcome to ECE 693B Fall 2024

In ECE 693B, we will gain solid theoretical understanding üìù of reinforcement learning (RL) and get hands-on experiences üíª of applying RL to research projects.

## Pedagogy

ECE 693B is structured as a sequential series of [modules](/ece693bspring2025/modules/), each taking approximately one to two weeks to complete. Each module has the following structure:

  * [Learning outcomes](/ece693bspring2025/outcomes/), describing the major goals for the module.
  * [Readings and other online resources](/ece693bspring2025/readings/), providing background material.
  * [Experiential learning activities](/ece693bspring2025/experiences/), providing a structured set of challenges enabling you to acquire mastery of material.
  * [Assessments](/ece693bspring2025/assessments/), which help you determine if you have acquired mastery of the material.
